    <translation>$appname is Fairware, which means &quot;open source software developed with expectation of fair contributions from users&quot;. Hours have been invested in this software with the expectation that users will be fair enough to compensate them. The &quot;Unpaid hours&quot; figure you see below is the hours that have yet to be compensated for this project.
    
If you like this application, please make a contribution that you consider fair. Thanks!

If you cannot afford to contribute, you can either ignore this reminder or send an e-mail at support@hardcoded.net so I can send you a registration key.

This dialog doesn't show when there are no unpaid hours or when you have a valid contribution key.</translation>
